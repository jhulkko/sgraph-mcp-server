# Throwaway AI Code

This directory contains temporary code created by AI for debugging, testing, and exploration purposes.

## Purpose

- **Debugging**: Quick scripts to test specific functionality
- **Prototyping**: Experimental code before integration
- **Validation**: One-off tests to verify assumptions
- **Analysis**: Scripts to understand system behavior

## Current Files

- `test_modular_structure.py` - Tests modular component imports
- `test_new_server.py` - Integration test for modular services
- *(Other files may be added and removed as needed)*

## Usage Guidelines

### For AI Agents:
- Feel free to create scripts here for any debugging needs
- Use descriptive filenames that indicate purpose
- Include comments explaining what you're testing
- Clean up when no longer needed

### For Developers:
- This directory is meant for temporary AI-generated code
- Files here should not be part of the main application
- Review and move useful code to appropriate locations
- Feel free to delete outdated files

## Cleanup Policy

Files in this directory are considered temporary and may be deleted at any time. Do not put anything here that needs to be preserved long-term.

## Examples

Good uses:
- Testing new architecture patterns
- Debugging specific issues
- Validating performance assumptions
- Quick prototypes for new features

Bad uses:
- Production code
- Important test cases (use `tests/` instead)
- Configuration files
- Documentation (use main project directories)
